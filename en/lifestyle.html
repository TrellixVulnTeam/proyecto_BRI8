                    <h2>Travel</h2>
                    <span > In travel, we find the best in ourselves and in others. We become an explorer, open to meeting new people, and learning new things, getting to experience different cultures, food, landscapes, architecture, history and languages. It's the feeling of the unknown, being surrounded by unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar setting. Luckily I'v been able to travel around Argentina, Brazil, France, Spain, Australia and United States. Every single one of this places is unique, so interestingly different in so many ways and I am really excited in planning many more trips getting to explore as many new cities as possible.

                    <h2>Pilot</h2>
                    <span > I started flying when I was 21, I'm now a private pilot with a multiengine rating, soon to be a commercial pilot. There is nothing like being up in the air and actually being in control, there is a sense of freedom that's not compared to anything else, it truly is amazing. I love flying on a calm spring or autumn morning when the air is smooth and if you're flying a little low you can see the tiny cars and trains pass below you. I have to confess I have a little obsession of flying every time I can over to an island that's close by to have lunch and spend the day until the sun sets, and I can't think of a more perfect way to spend a day than this. </span>

                    <h2>Sports</h2>
                    <span> I'm not into the typical sports like football, hockey and volleyball. Give me some boards and I'll be over the moon. Wakeboard was and is for sure my first love, the first time a tried I absolutely loved it, it's not so hard to learn, you don't get hurt while trying and you get the hang of it pretty quickly, wakeboard is what instantly led me into snowboard..<br> Im not gonna lie, the first few times I was not into snowboarding at all. Falling over and bruising so much without making any progress almost made me quit.. but let me tell you, when I got the hang of it I just loved how different, and beautiful it was to be cruising down a trail listening to the sound of the snow under your board; everything else sort of fades away it's just you, your board and the snow. Just a blissful, peaceful feeling. <br> Surfing is similar, except the part of bruising.. it's a really frustrating sport, it requires a lot of patience, lots of arm and shoulder muscle, and learning to respect the ocean.. you paddle your arms out and finally when you get the perfect wave, you stand up and THAT is when everything is suddenly worth it.  </span>
